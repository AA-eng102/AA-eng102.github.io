        <h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><b><i> Environmental degradation</i></b> refers to the deterioration of the environment through depletion 
            of resources, destruction of ecosystems, and pollution. It encompasses various processes that harm the natural environment and reduce its capacity to support life. Here are some key aspects of environmental degradation:</p>
            <ol class="container">
                <li>Loss of Biodiversity</li>
                <img src="biodiversity.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph">One of the most significant impacts of environmental degradation is the loss of biodiversity.
                     This occurs when habitats are destroyed or altered, leading to the extinction or decline of species.</p>
                <li>Deforestation</li>
                <img src="Deforestation.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph">The clearing of forests for agriculture, 
                    logging, or urbanization contributes to habitat loss, soil erosion, and disruption of ecosystems.
                </p>
                <li>Land Degradation</li>
                <img src="land degradation.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph">This includes soil erosion, desertification, and land pollution, which reduce the fertility 
                    and productivity of land for agriculture and other uses.
                </p>
                <li>Water Pollution</li>
                <img src="pexels-yogendras31-2480807.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph"> Contamination of water bodies (such as rivers, lakes, and oceans) 
                    by industrial waste, agricultural runoff, sewage, and plastic waste affects aquatic ecosystems and human health.</p>
                <li>Air Pollution</li>
                <img src="air pollution.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph">Emissions from vehicles, industries, and agriculture contribute to air pollution,
                     which can lead to respiratory diseases and environmental damage.
                </p>
                <li>Climate Change</li>
                <img src="climate change.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph"> Environmental degradation is closely linked to climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions
                     from human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Climate change exacerbates environmental stresses and impacts ecosystems worldwide.</p>
                <li>Loss of Natural Resources</li>
                <img src="natural resources.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph"> Overexploitation of natural resources such as minerals, fossil fuels, and 
                    freshwater contributes to environmental degradation and can lead to resource depletion.</p>
                <li>Urbanisation and Infrastructural Development</li>
                <img src="infrustructure.jpg" class="latest">
                <p class="overlap-paragraph"> Rapid urbanization often leads to habitat destruction, fragmentation of ecosystems,
                     and increased demand for resources and energy.

            <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 150px;">Climate change has had a devastating impact on Somalia, worsening <br> of drought and extreme food insecurity. The country’s political <br>instability has made it difficult to address its climate crisis and protect vulnerable <br>communities. By mid-2023, more than an estimated eight million Somalis – <br>nearly half of the
country’s population – will be experiencing crisis levels of food, <br> or worse</p>
